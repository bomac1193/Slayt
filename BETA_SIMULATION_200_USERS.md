## COHORT DESIGN (200 Users)

### Segment A: ICPs — Video-First Quality Creators (100 users)

| Sub-segment | Count | Profile | Follower Range | Monthly Revenue |
|-------------|-------|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| **A1: Rising Creators** | 40 | Video-first, 80%+ Reels/TikTok, taste-conscious, monetizing via brand deals | 50K-150K | $1K-$5K/mo |
| **A2: Mid-Tier Creators** | 35 | Established personal brand, cross-posting IG+TT, quality > quantity | 150K-500K | $5K-$20K/mo |
| **A3: Premium Creators** | 25 | High brand value, selective posting, reputation-protective, luxury/lifestyle | 500K-1M+ | $20K-$100K/mo |

### Segment B: Non-Customers — Adjacent Creators (60 users)

| Sub-segment | Count | Profile | Why They're Not ICP |
|-------------|-------|---------|---------------------|
| **B1: Volume Posters** | 20 | Post 3-5x/day, growth hackers, trend-chasers | Conviction scoring BLOCKS their strategy |
| **B2: Text-First Creators** | 15 | Twitter/LinkedIn thought leaders trying video | Wrong modality (Slayt is video-first) |
| **B3: Hobbyist Creators** | 15 | <10K followers, not monetizing, casual | Can't justify paid tier, low engagement |
| **B4: Agency Managers** | 10 | Manage 5-20 client accounts | No team features, wrong UX model |

### Segment C: Anti-Customers — Active Resistors (40 users)

| Sub-segment | Count | Profile | Why They Resist |
|-------------|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **C1: "AI is Cringe" Purists** | 15 | Reject AI-assisted anything, manual-only workflow | Philosophical opposition to conviction scoring |
| **C2: Platform Loyalists** | 10 | Deep Later/Buffer power users, invested in existing workflow | Switching cost too high |
| **C3: Quantity Maximalists** | 10 | Believe posting more = winning, "just post bro" | Conviction gating is the enemy |
| **C4: Budget-Zero Creators** | 5 | Will never pay for tools, use free schedulers only | Price sensitivity absolute |

## YEAR 1 SIMULATION: BEACHHEAD DISCOVERY

### Quarter 1 (Months 1-3): Beta Launch — Invitation Only

**Pricing:** Free beta, invite-only (200 codes)

**What happens:**

| Metric | Segment A (ICPs) | Segment B (Non-Cust) | Segment C (Anti-Cust) |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Activation (complete onboarding) | 82/100 (82%) | 38/60 (63%) | 12/40 (30%) |
| Taste Genome quiz completed | 75/82 (91%) | 20/38 (53%) | 3/12 (25%) |
| First post scheduled | 70/82 (85%) | 15/38 (39%) | 2/12 (17%) |
| Hit conviction gate (blocked post) | 45/70 (64%) | 14/15 (93%) | 2/2 (100%) |
| **Reaction to conviction gate:** | | | |
| → "This is amazing, saved me" | 32/45 (71%) | 2/14 (14%) | 0/2 (0%) |
| → "Annoying but I get it" | 10/45 (22%) | 4/14 (29%) | 0/2 (0%) |
| → "This is broken/wrong" | 3/45 (7%) | 8/14 (57%) | 2/2 (100%) |
| Week 4 retention | 65/82 (79%) | 12/38 (32%) | 1/12 (8%) |
| Week 12 retention | 52/82 (63%) | 5/38 (13%) | 0/12 (0%) |
| **NPS Score** | +62 | -15 | -78 |

**Key Q1 Findings:**

1. **Conviction gate is the product.** 71% of ICPs who hit the gate had a "wow" moment. This is the activation event. Non-customers HATE it. This confirms product-market fit for the ICP.

2. **Taste Genome quiz is the hook.** 91% of activated ICPs completed the quiz. The archetype reveal ("You're a CULL") creates emotional attachment. Non-customers don't care.

3. **Anti-customers self-select out fast.** 70% don't even activate. The 30% who do churn within 4 weeks. This is GOOD — it means the product has a strong opinion.

4. **Volume Posters (B1) are the loudest critics.** They'll post negative reviews: "This app literally won't let me post." This is free marketing to ICPs who think "Wait — an app that protects my brand?"

5. **Agency Managers (B4) want team features.** 8/10 asked for multi-account management. DON'T BUILD THIS. It dilutes the solo creator focus.

**Beachhead identified:** **A2 — Mid-tier creators (150K-500K followers)** who post 3-5x/week on IG Reels + TikTok. They have enough brand value to FEAR posting bad content, enough revenue to pay $49/mo, and enough volume to see conviction scoring compound over time.

---

### Quarter 2 (Months 4-6): Paid Conversion

**Pricing introduced:**
- Free: 5 posts/month, IG only, basic conviction
- Pro ($29/mo): IG + TikTok, full genome, unlimited
- Creator ($49/mo): + YouTube Shorts, advanced analytics, characters

**Conversion Results:**

| Tier | Segment A | Segment B | Segment C | Total |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Churned (left) | 18 | 50 | 39 | 107 |
| Free tier | 22 | 8 | 1 | 31 |
| Pro ($29) | 38 | 2 | 0 | 40 |
| Creator ($49) | 22 | 0 | 0 | 22 |
| **Active users** | **82** | **10** | **1** | **93** |
| **Paying users** | **60** | **2** | **0** | **62** |

**Monthly Revenue:** (38 × $29) + (22 × $49) = $1,102 + $1,078 = **$2,180 MRR**
**ARPU (paying):** $35.16
**Conversion rate (active → paid):** 62/93 = **66.7%**

**Key Q2 Findings:**

1. **66.7% paid conversion is exceptional** (industry avg for creator tools: 3-8%). This validates invitation-only + conviction gate as conversion drivers. Users who experience the conviction gate and stay → they're already sold.

2. **$49 Creator tier attracts A3 (premium creators).** 18/22 Creator subscribers are A2-A3 segment. They don't blink at $49 because a single bad post costs them $5K+ in brand deals.

3. **Free tier users are NOT freeloaders.** They're A1 (rising creators) evaluating if conviction scoring is worth it. 60% will convert within 6 months as their careers grow.

4. **Non-customer retention is 17%.** The 10 remaining non-customers are B2 (text-first) who use Slayt as a secondary scheduler. Low value, low engagement. Ignore them.

### Quarter 3-4 (Months 7-12): Product-Market Fit Confirmation

**What happens (Month 7-12):**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Active users (month 12) | 85 (organic growth via word-of-mouth) |
| Paying users | 68 |
| MRR | $2,890 |
| Monthly churn rate | 3.2% (healthy for creator tools) |
| NPS (paying users) | +71 |
| Feature most loved | Conviction gate (mentioned by 78% in surveys) |
| Feature most requested | "Show me WHY my score is low" (conviction explainability) |
| Referral rate | 22% of paying users referred 1+ creator |
| Posts published via Slayt | 4,200/month |
| Posts blocked by conviction gate | 890/month (21% block rate) |
| User override rate | 12% of blocked posts get overridden |

**Year 1 Summary:**
- **Revenue:** ~$28K ARR
- **Core metric:** 21% post block rate = users are genuinely creating better content
- **Brand signal:** "Only your best" is LIVED, not just marketed
- **Beachhead locked:** Mid-tier video creators (150K-500K), IG + TikTok, $29-49/mo

---

## YEAR 2 SIMULATION: SCALE THE BEACHHEAD

### Growth Strategy: Controlled Expansion

**Pricing evolution:**
- Free: 5 posts/month (unchanged)
- Pro ($29/mo): Unchanged
- Creator ($49/mo): Unchanged
- **NEW: Atelier ($99/mo):** Ecosystem bundle (Slayt + Subtaste + Folio integration)

**User growth model:**

| Quarter | Active Users | Paying Users | MRR | Key Event |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----|-----------|
| Q5 | 150 | 105 | $4,800 | YouTube Shorts launched |
| Q6 | 280 | 190 | $8,200 | First creator testimonial goes viral |
| Q7 | 450 | 310 | $13,500 | Subtaste integration live |
| Q8 | 680 | 470 | $20,100 | Waitlist hits 2,000 |

**Year 2 Revenue:** ~$140K ARR

**Key Year 2 Events:**

1. **Month 14: The Viral Testimonial.** A 300K-follower creator posts: "Slayt literally stopped me from posting a video that would have tanked my brand deal. Conviction score: 38. I rewrote the hook, rescored at 78, posted it. 2M views." This tweet gets 15K likes. Waitlist explodes.

2. **Month 16: Subtaste Integration.** When Slayt's Taste Genome connects to Subtaste's archetype engine, the conviction explanations become MUCH richer. Instead of "Score: 45" it says "Your CULL genome predicts your audience expects minimalist hooks. This video opens with chaotic energy — that's why conviction is low." Users love it. NPS jumps to +76.

3. **Month 18: The Waitlist.** Maintaining invitation-only with a waitlist creates FOMO. Creators who get invited feel exclusive. The rejection of non-ICPs becomes a feature, not a bug. "I finally got my Slayt invite" becomes a flex.

4. **Month 20: Atelier Tier ($99/mo).** 15% of Creator users upgrade. They want Folio's content intelligence feeding their conviction scores. This is the ecosystem moat activating — once you're in Slayt + Subtaste + Folio, switching to Later means losing your taste genome.

---

## YEAR 3 SIMULATION: MOAT HARDENING

### Growth + Revenue:

| Quarter | Active Users | Paying Users | MRR | ARPU |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----|------|
| Q9 | 1,100 | 780 | $38K | $48.72 |
| Q10 | 1,800 | 1,250 | $62K | $49.60 |
| Q11 | 2,800 | 1,950 | $97K | $49.74 |
| Q12 | 4,200 | 2,900 | $148K | $51.03 |

**Year 3 Revenue:** ~$1.04M ARR (crossed $1M!)

**Key Year 3 Events:**

1. **Month 26: Later copies "Content Score."** Later launches a basic content scoring feature. It's generic (not personalized to taste genome). Slayt users laugh at it in Discord: "Later's score told me every post is 7/10. Slayt actually stopped me from ruining my aesthetic." The copycat validates the category.

2. **Month 28: StanVault Integration.** Posts published through Slayt now track superfan conversion. Creators can see: "This 82-conviction post converted 14 new superfans." This closes the loop: taste → conviction → post → superfan → revenue. No other tool does this.

3. **Month 30: Enterprise Inquiries Begin.** Talent agencies and MCNs want Slayt for their roster. You say NO. This is the hardest decision — $50K+ contracts vs staying solo-creator focused. The right answer is NO for now. Build the solo moat deeper.

4. **Month 32: Taste Genome hits 10M signals.** The aggregate taste data (anonymized) becomes a proprietary dataset. You can now predict which content archetypes will perform on which platforms. This data is IMPOSSIBLE to replicate — it's the #1 isolating mechanism.

---

## YEAR 4 SIMULATION: TAM EXPANSION

### The Expansion Decision

**Option A: Stay Solo Creator (Conservative)**
- Continue beachhead. 8,000 users, $3M ARR.
- High margins (85%+), profitable, sustainable.
- Risk: Market ceiling at ~$10M ARR.

**Option B: Expand to Teams/Agencies (Risky)**
- Add team features. Opens $2B agency market.
- Risk: Dilutes "solo creator" brand. Becomes another Hootsuite.
- Historical pattern: Every creator tool that went enterprise lost its soul.

**Option C: Expand via Ecosystem (Recommended)**
- Keep Slayt solo-creator only.
- Launch "Atelio for Business" as a SEPARATE product using Slayt's taste genome API.
- Agencies pay $299-999/mo for API access to conviction scoring.
- Solo creators never see enterprise features. Brand stays pure.

### Year 4 Numbers (Option C):

| Quarter | Solo Users | API Customers | Solo MRR | API MRR | Total MRR |
|---------|-----------|--------------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Q13 | 6,000 | 15 | $290K | $45K | $335K |
| Q14 | 8,200 | 35 | $400K | $105K | $505K |
| Q15 | 11,000 | 60 | $540K | $180K | $720K |
| Q16 | 14,000 | 90 | $690K | $270K | $960K |

**Year 4 Revenue:** ~$7.6M ARR
**Blended margin:** 78% (SaaS + API)

## PRICING ANALYSIS: EXCLUSIVE/LUXURY/INVITATION-ONLY

### Does Invitation-Only Hurt or Help?

**SIMULATION RESULTS:**

| Metric | Open Access Model | Invitation-Only Model | Delta |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|-------|
| Year 1 signups | 2,400 | 200 | -92% |
| Year 1 activation rate | 23% | 82% | +256% |
| Year 1 paid conversion | 4.2% | 66.7% | +1,488% |
| Year 1 MRR | $3,200 | $2,890 | -10% |
| Year 1 NPS | +18 | +71 | +294% |
| Year 1 churn (monthly) | 11% | 3.2% | -71% |
| Year 2 MRR | $12,000 | $20,100 | +68% |
| Year 3 MRR | $45,000 | $148,000 | +229% |
| Year 4 MRR | $120,000 | $960,000 | +700% |

**Verdict: Invitation-only DRAMATICALLY outperforms open access.**

**Why:**
1. **Self-selection.** Only motivated creators apply. Activation rate 82% vs 23%.
2. **Social proof.** "I got invited to Slayt" = creator flex. Free marketing.
3. **Community quality.** Discord/feedback is all ICPs, not noise from B/C segments.
4. **Conviction gate works.** When ICPs hit the gate, they love it. When randoms hit it, they rage-quit and leave 1-star reviews.
5. **Premium positioning.** $49/mo feels fair when you had to apply and wait. $49/mo feels expensive when you stumbled in from Google.

### Does Luxury Pricing Hurt?

**Test: What if Pro was $79/mo and Creator was $149/mo?**

| Metric | $29/$49 Pricing | $79/$149 Pricing | Delta |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Year 1 paying users | 68 | 31 | -54% |
| Year 1 MRR | $2,890 | $3,450 | +19% |
| Year 1 NPS | +71 | +58 | -18% |
| Year 2 paying users | 470 | 180 | -62% |
| Year 2 MRR | $20,100 | $18,900 | -6% |
| Year 3 MRR | $148K | $98K | -34% |

**Verdict: Luxury pricing ($79/$149) HURTS long-term growth.**

The beachhead (150K-500K creators earning $5K-20K/mo) can afford $49 but $149 makes them pause. The conviction-to-revenue loop needs VOLUME of posts to build the taste genome moat. Fewer users = slower data flywheel = weaker moat.

**RECOMMENDED PRICING:**
- Free: 5 posts/month (hook)
- Pro: $29/mo (mainstream ICP)
- Creator: $49/mo (premium ICP)
- Atelier: $99/mo (ecosystem power users)
- API: $299+/mo (B2B, separate product)

Keep it **invitation-only** but NOT luxury-priced. The exclusivity is in ACCESS, not in price.

## BLUE OCEAN vs RED OCEAN ANALYSIS

### Current State: BLUE OCEAN ✅

**Slayt's Blue Ocean Canvas:**

| Factor | Later/Buffer (Red Ocean) | Slayt (Blue Ocean) |
|--------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Platform count | 6-8 platforms (RAISE) | 3 platforms (REDUCE) |
| Team features | Full team workflow (RAISE) | Solo only (ELIMINATE) |
| Post volume | Unlimited (RAISE) | Quality-gated (REDUCE) |
| Content scoring | None (ELIMINATE) | Conviction 0-100 (CREATE) |
| Taste learning | None (ELIMINATE) | 12-archetype genome (CREATE) |
| Quality blocking | None (ELIMINATE) | Hard gate at <50 (CREATE) |
| Analytics depth | Deep multi-platform (RAISE) | Basic, conviction-focused (REDUCE) |
| Price | $15-99/mo (competitive) | $29-49/mo (value) |
| Target user | Everyone (broad) | Video creators 150K-500K (narrow) |

**Why It's Blue Ocean:**
- NO competitor has conviction scoring
- NO competitor has taste genome learning
- NO competitor BLOCKS posts from publishing
- The entire scheduler industry competes on "post MORE to MORE platforms"
- Slayt competes on "post BETTER to FEWER platforms"

### Threat Timeline: When Does It Turn Red?

| Year | Threat Level | What Happens |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Year 1** | 🟢 GREEN | No competitor notices. Too small, too niche. |
| **Year 2** | 🟢 GREEN | Later/Buffer notice but dismiss as "too opinionated." They won't copy conviction gating because it REDUCES their core metric (posts scheduled). |
| **Year 3** | 🟡 YELLOW | Later launches "Content Score" — generic, not personalized. Validates the category. Slayt's taste genome is 2+ years ahead in data. |
| **Year 4** | 🟡 YELLOW | Instagram/TikTok launch native "post quality" features. These are platform-specific, not cross-platform. Slayt's cross-platform conviction + taste genome remains unique. |
| **Year 5+** | 🟠 ORANGE | A well-funded startup copies the full model. But Slayt has 10M+ taste signals, ecosystem integration, and brand loyalty. Data moat holds. |

**Assessment: Blue ocean for 3-4 years.** The key is that conviction gating is ANTI-GROWTH for schedulers. Later will never truly copy it because it reduces their core metric (volume of scheduled posts). That's the strategic asymmetry.

---

## MOATS & ISOLATING MECHANISMS

### MOAT 1: Taste Genome Data (STRONGEST — Network Effect)
- **What:** 12-archetype classification trained on user behavior
- **Isolating mechanism:** Each user's 100+ signals compound over months. After 6 months of use, their genome is deeply personalized. Switching to Later means starting from zero.
- **Data network effect:** Aggregate anonymized signals improve conviction predictions for ALL users. More users → better predictions → more users.
- **Time to replicate:** 2-3 years minimum (need 10K+ users generating signals)
- **Strength:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

### MOAT 2: Conviction Scoring Algorithm (STRONG — Process IP)
- **What:** Multi-factor scoring with anti-gaming (trend penalty, temporal decay)
- **Isolating mechanism:** The algorithm improves with user overrides (when users override a low score and the post performs well, the model learns). This feedback loop is proprietary.
- **Time to replicate:** 1-2 years (algorithm can be copied, but calibration data cannot)
- **Strength:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

### MOAT 3: Ecosystem Integration (GROWING — Switching Cost)
- **What:** Slayt + Subtaste + Folio + StanVault + Starforge
- **Isolating mechanism:** Once a creator's taste genome flows into Subtaste (archetype), Folio (content intelligence), and StanVault (superfan tracking), leaving Slayt means losing the ENTIRE ecosystem context.
- **Time to replicate:** 3-5 years (need to build 5 integrated products)
- **Strength:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (growing to ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ by Year 3)

### MOAT 4: Brand Identity — "Only Your Best" (MEDIUM — Brand)
- **What:** Opinionated brand that REJECTS low-quality content
- **Isolating mechanism:** The brand attracts ICPs and repels non-customers. Anti-customers who rage-quit are FREE MARKETING ("This app literally won't let me post" → ICPs say "Wait, I NEED that").
- **Time to replicate:** 1-2 years (brand can be copied, but authenticity cannot be faked)
- **Strength:** ⭐⭐⭐

### MOAT 5: Invitation-Only Distribution (TEMPORARY — Scarcity)
- **What:** Waitlist + invite codes create FOMO
- **Isolating mechanism:** Creators who get in feel exclusive. High activation, high conversion.
- **Time to replicate:** Instant (anyone can add a waitlist)
- **Strength:** ⭐⭐ (tactical, not structural)

### Strengthening Recommendations:

| Moat | Current | Action to Strengthen | Target |
|------|---------|---------------------|--------|
| Taste Genome | 10K signals | Build public "Creator Taste Report" (anonymized insights) to attract data contributors | 1M signals by Year 2 |
| Conviction Algorithm | Basic feedback | Add post-performance tracking: compare conviction score vs actual engagement. Auto-calibrate. | Self-improving by Year 2 |
| Ecosystem | 2 integrations | Ship Folio + StanVault integration. Make conviction score visible across all apps. | 4 integrations by Year 2 |
| Brand | Strong positioning | Publish "The Conviction Manifesto" — thought leadership on post-vanity metrics | Category ownership by Year 2 |
| Distribution | Invite-only | Add referral program: existing users get 3 invites/month. Creates organic growth without losing exclusivity. | 50% of new users from referrals |

---

## ERRC FRAMEWORK (Eliminate-Reduce-Raise-Create)

### ELIMINATE ❌

| Factor | Why Eliminate | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Multi-platform posting (6+ platforms)** | Spreads thin, dilutes video focus. IG + TT + YT Shorts is enough. | ✅ Already eliminated |
| **Team/agency features** | Wrong market. Solo creator focus. | ✅ Already eliminated |
| **Vanity metrics dashboard** | Likes/followers/views are exactly what we're replacing. Don't show them prominently. | ⚠️ Still showing basic analytics — reduce visibility |
| **Bulk scheduling** | Encourages quantity over quality. Antithetical to conviction. | ✅ Not built |
| **Auto-posting without review** | Every post should pass conviction check. No fire-and-forget. | ✅ Conviction gate prevents this |
| **RSS/blog-to-social** | Content repurposing without taste alignment is anti-brand. | ✅ Not built |

### REDUCE ↘️

| Factor | Why Reduce | Current → Target |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Analytics complexity** | Creators don't need 50 metrics. Show conviction trend + post performance. | Complex → 5 key metrics |
| **Content calendar features** | Month-view calendar is table stakes but shouldn't be the hero. Conviction is the hero. | Featured → Secondary |
| **Platform connection friction** | OAuth is painful. Reduce to 1-click. | 3-step → 1-step |
| **Onboarding length** | Get to first conviction score in <3 minutes. | 10 min → 3 min |
| **Settings/configuration** | Creators don't want to configure. Smart defaults. | 20 settings → 5 settings |

### RAISE ↗️

| Factor | Why Raise | Current → Target |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **Conviction score visibility** | Make it THE number creators obsess over. Show it everywhere — grid, calendar, sidebar. | Subtle → Dominant UI element |
| **Taste Genome depth** | Show creators their taste evolution over time. Make it feel like a personal growth journey. | Basic archetype → Rich narrative |
| **Post-conviction feedback** | After blocking a post, explain WHY and HOW to fix it. This is the coaching moment. | "Score: 38" → "Your hook contradicts your CULL aesthetic. Try opening with silence instead of chaos." |
| **Cross-platform conviction comparison** | "This content scores 78 on Instagram but only 52 on TikTok. Post to IG only." | Not built → Core feature |
| **Creator success stories** | Surface anonymized conviction wins: "Creators who scored 80+ got 3.2x more saves." | None → Weekly insights |

### CREATE 🆕

| Factor | Why Create | Impact |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Conviction Gate (done)** | The world's first scheduler that says NO. This IS the product. | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Highest-impact feature |
| **Taste Genome (done)** | Psychometric content profiling. No one else has this. | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Core differentiator |
| **Post-Performance Conviction Loop** | After posting, track actual performance. Feed back into conviction algorithm. Score improves over time. | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Self-improving moat |
| **Conviction Leaderboard** | Anonymous "How does your conviction compare to creators in your niche?" Creates aspirational metric. | ⭐⭐⭐ Community engagement |
| **"Conviction Report" for Brand Deals** | Export a report showing your average conviction score to potential sponsors. Proves brand quality. | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Monetization enabler for creators |
| **Taste Genome API** | Let other tools query conviction scores. Becomes infrastructure, not just app. | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Platform moat (Year 3+) |

---

## BLIND SPOT ANALYSIS (From Simulated Feedback)

### Blind Spot 1: "Conviction Score Feels Arbitrary" (CRITICAL)
**Source:** 34% of Year 1 users
**Feedback:** "You gave me a 45 but didn't explain why. Am I supposed to trust a number?"
**Risk:** If users don't trust the score, they override it constantly, defeating the purpose.
**Fix:** **Conviction explainability.** Show component breakdown: "Taste: 72, Performance: 28, Brand: 61. Your performance score is low because the hook relies on a trend that peaked 3 weeks ago." This is the #1 feature request and the #1 blind spot.

### Blind Spot 2: "My Best Content Got Blocked" (HIGH)
**Source:** 18% of users experienced a false positive (high-performing post blocked by conviction gate)
**Feedback:** "Slayt blocked my video. I overrode it, posted anyway, and it got 500K views. Your AI is wrong."
**Risk:** Even ONE false positive that goes viral destroys trust. Creator tells everyone.
**Fix:** **Post-performance feedback loop.** When an overridden post performs well, automatically adjust the model. Show the user: "You were right — we've updated your conviction model based on this post's performance."

### Blind Spot 3: "Where Are My Old Posts?" (MEDIUM)
**Source:** 22% of users after 3+ months
**Feedback:** "I've posted 200 things through Slayt. Where's my archive? I can't find that carousel from October."
**Risk:** Media library is built but not prominent enough. Content gets lost.
**Fix:** Raise media library visibility. Add conviction-scored search: "Show me my posts that scored 80+ in the last 90 days."

### Blind Spot 4: "TikTok Conviction ≠ Instagram Conviction" (MEDIUM)
**Source:** 28% of cross-platform users
**Feedback:** "Same video scores 75 on Instagram and 52 on TikTok. Why? What do I change?"
**Risk:** Without platform-specific explanations, cross-platform conviction feels random.
**Fix:** Platform-specific conviction breakdown. "On TikTok, your opening 1 second matters more. This video's first frame is a title card — TikTok penalizes static openings."

### Blind Spot 5: "I Can't Get My Invite" (OPPORTUNITY)
**Source:** Waitlist applicants
**Feedback:** "I applied 2 months ago. Still waiting. I'm going to just use Later."
**Risk:** Waitlist too long = lost users to competitors.
**Fix:** Referral-based priority. Existing users can invite 3 people/month. This maintains exclusivity while accelerating growth through trusted networks.

### Blind Spot 6: "PNGs and Non-JPEG Formats" (LOW-MEDIUM)
**Source:** 8% of uploads
**Feedback:** "I uploaded a PNG and the colors shifted" or "WebP files don't upload"
**Risk:** The JPEG compression pipeline converts everything to JPEG. Some creators work in PNG for quality.
**Fix:** Detect format and preserve when possible. Only compress to JPEG when exceeding size limits.

### Blind Spot 7: "No Undo After Posting" (LOW)
**Source:** 5% of users
**Feedback:** "I posted through Slayt and realized I had a typo. Can't recall it."
**Risk:** Low frequency but high pain when it happens.
**Fix:** Not Slayt's problem — platform limitation. But could add: "Post review period: 60-second delay before actually publishing. Cancel within 60s."

## BEACHHEAD → SCALABLE TAM

### Beachhead (Year 1-2): Mid-Tier Video Creators

| Attribute | Definition |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Who** | Solo video creators, 150K-500K followers |

## WHAT'S WORKING (Keep / Double Down)

| Feature/Strategy | Evidence | Action |
|------------------|----------|--------|
| **Conviction gate** | 71% of ICPs have "wow" moment. #1 mentioned feature. | Double down. Make it THE product identity. |
| **Taste Genome quiz** | 91% completion rate among ICPs. Creates emotional attachment. | Add more quiz types. Weekly micro-quizzes. |
| **Invitation-only** | 82% activation vs 23% open access. 66.7% conversion. | Keep for Year 1-2. Add referral invites. |
| **Solo creator focus** | Agency requests prove market pull but dilution risk. | Stay solo. Build API for B2B separately. |
| **3-platform limit** | Users don't miss LinkedIn/Twitter. Video focus is clarity. | Don't add platforms. Go deeper on IG/TT/YT. |
| **$29/$49 pricing** | 66.7% conversion. Doesn't feel expensive to monetizing creators. | Keep. Don't go luxury. |

## WHAT'S NOT WORKING (Fix / Rethink)

| Issue | Evidence | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Conviction explainability** | 34% say "score feels arbitrary." #1 complaint. | CRITICAL FIX: Show component breakdown + actionable fix suggestions. |
| **False positive blocking** | 18% experienced a great post getting blocked. Trust breaker. | Build post-performance feedback loop. Auto-calibrate. |
| **Upload UX** | Black screen, EXIF rotation, size limits — user friction. | Fixed in latest commits. Continue stress testing. |
| **Cross-platform conviction gap** | 28% confused by different scores per platform. | Add platform-specific conviction explanations. |
| **Onboarding time** | Takes 10+ min to first conviction score. | Reduce to 3 min: skip genome quiz, show first score immediately, quiz later. |

## FINAL VERDICT

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Is it blue ocean?** | YES — for 3-4 years. Conviction gating is anti-growth for incumbents. They won't truly copy it. |
| **What's the beachhead?** | Mid-tier video creators (150K-500K), IG + TikTok, $29-49/mo |
| **Does invitation-only help?** | YES — dramatically. 82% activation vs 23%. Keep it. |
| **Does luxury pricing help?** | NO — $79+ hurts volume, slows data flywheel, weaker moat. Keep $29/$49. |
| **What's the #1 MOAT?** | Taste Genome data. Compounds with every user signal. 2-3 year head start. |
| **What's the #1 blind spot?** | Conviction explainability. Users need to UNDERSTAND why a score is low, not just see a number. |
| **What's the scalable TAM?** | $8.7M ARR by Year 4 via beachhead expansion + API platform. |
| **What kills this?** | False positives that go viral ("Slayt blocked my best post"). Fix with feedback loop. |
| **What's the revolutionary value?** | "The only AI that protects your brand by saying NO." Every other tool says yes to everything. |
