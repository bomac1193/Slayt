## Tone & Voice Guidelines

### **How to use "Only your best" in copy:**

✅ **DO:**
- Use it as a standalone statement
- Pair with conviction/quality messaging
- Emphasize the filtering/protection aspect
- Keep it confident, authoritative

❌ **DON'T:**
- Over-explain it
- Make it apologetic ("We only let your best...")
- Use it in contexts unrelated to quality

### **Good Examples:**

> "We built Slayt on one principle: Only your best."

> "Other schedulers post everything. Slayt? Only your best."

> "Schedule 100 posts. We'll help you choose the 10 that matter. Only your best."

### **Bad Examples:**

> "We try to make sure that only your best content gets posted" ❌ (too apologetic)

> "Only your best stuff goes live with us" ❌ (too casual, "stuff" weakens it)

> "Only your best is good enough" ❌ (redundant, preachy)

---

## Visual Pairing

### **Typography Recommendations**

**"Only your best"** should be:
- Clean, modern sans-serif
- Medium weight (not too bold, not too light)
- Generous letter spacing for emphasis
- All lowercase OR title case (avoid ALL CAPS)

**Examples:**
```
only your best     (lowercase - modern, confident)
Only Your Best     (title case - professional)
ONLY YOUR BEST     (all caps - too aggressive, avoid)
```

### **Color Palette Suggestions**

The slogan should feel:
- **Confident** → Deep blues, blacks
- **Premium** → Gold, deep purple accents
- **Clean** → White space, minimal

| **Later** | "Plan, schedule, analyze" | "Only your best" - We have standards, not just automation |
| **Planoly** | "Visually plan your feed" | "Only your best" - We predict performance, not just preview |

- "Only your best" + Slayt logo (combined mark)
- Class 42: SaaS, software, scheduling services

## FAQ

**Q: Should we add a period? "Only your best."**
A: Optional. Use period for final/emphatic statements, no period for taglines.

**Q: Can we use "Only the best" instead?**
A: No. "Your" is critical - it makes it personal to the creator.

**Q: What about "Only your best. Always."?**
A: Use "Always" as an optional extension in long-form copy, but primary slogan is just "Only your best"

**Q: Should it be on every page?**
A: Homepage hero, about page, footer. Not necessary on every page (avoid repetition fatigue).

## Alternative Slogans (Archived)

For reference, here were the other top contenders:

**Runner-ups:**
1. "Your best only" (close alternative)
2. "Taste over trends" (philosophical)
3. "Know before you grow" (catchy)
4. "Only your best. Always." (4-word version)

**Why we didn't choose them:**
- "Your best only" - Slightly awkward inversion
- "Taste over trends" - Less clear product benefit
- "Know before you grow" - Less emphasis on quality
- "Only your best. Always." - Breaks 3-word rule

**Final decision: "Only your best"** remains the strongest.
